                <p>Daichi Sakamoto started cooking at age five, helping his mother prepare bentos for his father, younger sister, and himself. Chashu was never a missing component. Mother Sakamoto had learned how to make it when she studied abroad in Hong Kong. It was young Chef Sakamoto who mixed the marinade, a formula he perfected as he grew into his teens.</p>
                <p>Many years later, he apprenticed under famed Chef Kazue Inoue at a luxury ryokan in the Nagano prefecture. There, he studied the art of kaiseki for seven years, and took a particular shine to the futamono and tome-wan soup-based dishes. His calling was starting to simmer.</p>

                <p>The next week, Chef Sakamoto flew to the “Pearl City” and discovered that he felt more at home than ever. He knew that he could meld the umami flavors and smoky scents of Cantonese cuisine with the richness and nuances of ramen. He went back to Tokyo to learn from Chef Fukui, and with her blessing, returned to Hong Kong seven years later.</p>
